		<h2>About Tesla</h2>
		<p class="first">Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to 
		sustainable energy.</p>
		<p class="second"><a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_CA" target="_blank">Tesla</a> was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers in Silicon 
		Valley who wanted to prove that electric cars could be better than gasoline&#45; powered cars. 
		They wanted to make affordable and efficient electric cars that would work 
		towards to their mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. 
		Tesla’s engineers first designed a powertrain for a sports car built around an AC 
		induction motor, patented in 1888 by Nikola Tesla, the inventor who inspired the 
		company’s name. The resulting Tesla Roadster was launched in 2008. This Roadster 
		would accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds and achieve a range of 245 miles 
		per charge of its lithium ion battery. Tesla sold more than 2,400 Roadsters, now 
		on the road in more than 30 countries. Tesla’s vehicles are produced at its factory 
		in Fremont, California, previously home to New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., 
		a joint venture between Toyota and General Motors. The Tesla Factory has returned 
		thousands of jobs to the area and is capable of producing 2,000 cars a week. The 
		company is expanding its manufacturing footprint into other areas, including in 
		Tilburg, the Netherlands, where it has an assembly facility, and Lathrop, 
		California, where it has a specialized production plant. To reduce the costs of 
		lithium ion battery packs, Tesla and key strategic partners including Panasonic 
		have begun construction of a gigafactory in Nevada that will facilitate the 
		production of a mass&#45; market affordable vehicle, Model 3. By 2018, the gigafactory 
		will produce more lithium ion cells than all of the world’s combined output in 2013. 
		The gigafactory will also produce battery packs intended for use in stationary 
		storage, helping to improve robustness of the electrical grid, reduce energy costs 
		for businesses and residences, and provide a backup supply of power.</p>
		<p class="third">Tesla is not just an automaker, but also a technology and design 
		company with a focus on energy innovation.</p>
		<h3>Model S</h3>
		<p class="second">In 2012, Tesla launched Model S, the world’s first premium 
		electric sedan. Built from the ground up to be 100 percent electric, Model S has 
		redefined the very concept of a four&#45; door car. Model S provides the comfort and 
		utility of a family sedan while achieving the acceleration of a sports car: 0 to 
		60 mph in about five seconds. Its flat battery pack is integrated into the chassis 
		and sits below the occupant cabin, lending the car a low center of gravity that 
		enables outstanding road holding and handling while driving 265 miles per charge. 
		Model S was named Motor Trend’s 2013 Car of the Year and achieved a 5&#45; star safety 
		rating from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In late 2014, 
		Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled two dual motor all&#45;  wheel drive configurations of 
		Model S that further improve the vehicle’s handling and performance. The 85D 
		features a high efficiency motor at the front and rear, giving the car unparalleled 
		control of traction in all conditions. The P85D pairs a high efficiency front motor 
		with a performance rear motor for supercar acceleration, achieving a 0 to 60 mph 
		time of 3.2 seconds &#45;  the fastest four&#45; door production car ever made. The model S 
		has many outstanding features, including&#58;</p>
