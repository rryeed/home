		<h2>About SpaceX</h2>
		<p class="second"><a href="http://www.spacex.com" target="_blank">SpaceX</a> has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. 
		It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low&#45;  Earth orbit, 
		which it first accomplished in December 2010. The company made history again in 
		May 2012 when its Dragon spacecraft attached to the International Space Station, 
		exchanged cargo payloads, and returned safely to Earth — a technically challenging 
		feat previously accomplished only by governments. Since then Dragon has delivered 
		cargo to and from the space station multiple times, providing regular cargo resupply 
		missions for NASA. Under a $1.6 billion contract with NASA, SpaceX is flying 
		numerous cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station, for a total 
		of at least 20 flights under the Commercial Resupply Services contract. In 2016, 
		NASA awarded SpaceX a second version of that contract that will cover a minimum of 
		6 additional flights from 2019 onward. In the near future, SpaceX will carry crew
		 as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program as well. Dragon was designed from the 
		 outset to carry astronauts and SpaceX is in the process of upgrading Dragon to 
		 make it crew&#45; ready. SpaceX is the world’s fastest&#45;  growing provider of launch 
		 services and has over 70 future missions on its manifest, representing over $10 
		 billion in contracts. These include commercial satellite launches as well as NASA 
		 and other US Government missions. Currently under development is the Falcon Heavy, 
		 which will be the world’s most powerful rocket. All the while, SpaceX continues 
		 to work toward one of its key goals—developing reusable rockets, a feat that will 
		 transform space exploration by delivering highly reliable vehicles at radically 
		 reduced costs. The main SpaceX headquarters is located in Hawthorne, California and 
		 the three launch facilities are located in Florida, California, and Texas.</p>
